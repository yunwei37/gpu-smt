# gpu-smt

A research prototype for **low-latency and high-throughput verification serving**.

The long-term goal is a transparent runtime that accelerates existing formal verification workloads without requiring changes to Z3/cvc5/Lean or to the applications that use them.

The current research hypothesis is:

> Modern verification workloads are increasingly streams of related jobs. A runtime can recover shared contexts across otherwise independent jobs and reuse solver state to improve both tail latency and aggregate throughput.

## Current status

Milestone M0 is implemented on the `research/verification-serving` branch:

- research plan and prior-art map;
- streaming Z3 trace capture shim;
- SMT-LIB trace/context analyzer;
- synthetic cold-vs-incremental Z3 benchmark;
- CI smoke tests with stock Z3.

The immediate goal is **workload characterization**, not GPU acceleration. We first need to measure whether real Verus/Dafny/Viper/Kani workloads expose enough cross-job context reuse.

## Quick start

With Z3 installed:

```bash
python3 bench/synthetic_prefix_bench.py \
  --queries 32 \
  --prefix-constraints 512 \
  --dump-dir traces \
  --json result.json

python3 tools/analyze_smt_trace.py traces \
  --json trace-analysis.json
```

Capture a real interactive Z3 client:

```bash
GPU_SMT_REAL_Z3=/usr/bin/z3 \
GPU_SMT_TRACE_DIR=$PWD/traces \
python3 tools/z3_capture.py -in
```

The intended long-term integration is a drop-in solver shim or launcher, similar in deployment spirit to `ccache`/`sccache`, with a stateful verification-serving runtime underneath.

## Research scope

Hard constraints for the first system:

1. stock solver/checker backends;
2. no application source changes for baseline integration;
3. semantic compatibility;
4. low-latency and high-throughput SLOs are both first-class;
5. GPU support is optional and must preserve correctness through validation/fallback.
