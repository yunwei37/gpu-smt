# OpenAI math: source coverage and native stratified measurements

Pinned repository: [openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math/tree/4eaee87548250b2682affda7d05d947c05554bae),
commit4eaee87548250b2682affda7d05d947c05554bae (2026-10-30T00:35:35Z).
Lean4.34.1; Mathlib d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612.
The root and lean licenses are Apache-2.0; third-party dependencies retain their
licenses. Every manifest dependency revision is in static-4eaee875/dependencies.csv.

## Latest archived native evidence

Lean4.34.1 and pinned Mathlib cache are prepared on the existing PVC.
No full-library build or globally finite CPU-hour confidence interval has
completed. Static source coverage and successful native compilation are
different measurements.

| Evidence | Scope |

The42primary probability targets span21source-size/import-depth/kernel-token
strata. Dependencies and purposeful stresses receive no extra population
weight. Missing/censored/budget-exceeded observations remain in the frame;
they are not zero-cost outcomes or replaced by easier sources.
[Current W state](../W-status.md) records sole active capture ownership.

At the new standard-artifact point,26unchanged sources compiled without
sorry. Sum native CPU712.009670s; group471.845673s. Largest complete cell
(45,251small non-kernel/depth11–100modules) estimates74.1775CPUh with a
fragile cell-only nominal95%interval[0,623.1803]. This is not a full-build
estimate or CI. All16pending random draws and incomplete strata remain
visible in its coverage tables.

For a complete stratum, the Horvitz–Thompson total is N*samplemean, with
SRS-without-replacement finite-population variance. Nominal t intervals use
Welch–Satterthwaite degrees of freedom and assume approximately normal costs.
Two observations/heavy tails do not justify a confidence guarantee.
The [precision plan](precision-panel-plan/) specifies an independent
conditional-remainder sample rather than naively pooling an adaptive n8.

Compiler-artifact timing excludes Lake driver/setup, external caches and
linking. It is not a measured full Lake build or an8/24-core throughput run.
No native clocks/costs are pooled across HB,SDK,threads,profiling,artifact
or memory-guard points. Historical child self timers worked despite denied parent signals.
After the user-authorized privileged restart, owned-process signals work and
EPFL13733 is retired; historical censored records remain unchanged. -M is cooperative RSS checking
and1s sampled whole-tree RSS is not a kernel hard quota.

## Complete source coverage

163,097 .lean files /1,785,499,363bytes are enumerated and content-scanned.
The recursive Git tree was truncated; partial entries were discarded and
discipline subtrees enumerated completely. The old53,554/474MB observation was
a lower bound, not corpus size. Files are source blobs, not accepted proofs.

| Source group | Files | Source bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| OAI/Combinatorics/Ramsey |444|222,614,562|
| OAI/Analysis/MutuallyUnbiased |3,386|205,200,466|
| OAI/Analysis/PlanarPacking |562|141,680,548|
| OAI/MathematicalPhysics/Transonic |466|83,494,755|
| OAI/Algorithms/SubexponentialSAT |3,977|35,509,858|

The inventory has744 source-directory groups, not744 independent Lake projects.
The publisher supplies one large library. Median file size is4,400bytes;
p99 is80,781bytes. The largest1.6%of files (2,610files) account for40.11%of
source bytes. This is a size statistic and says nothing about73%of runtime.

## Computation and tactic identifiers

Counts exclude nested comments and string literals; they are lexical
occurrences, not executed calls or checked theorem counts.

| Identifier/form | Occurrences | Files |
|---|---:|---:|
| decide (including +kernel) |1,686,012|16,766|
| decide +kernel |1,354,379|5,848|
| native_decide |0|0|
| bv_decide |0|0|
| direct ofReduceBool |0|0|
| simp |675,366|96,034|
| rfl |520,550|80,335|
| norm_num |183,572|35,471|
| omega |169,870|31,343|
| grind |650|128|

The number of theorems with transitive ofReduceBool axiom dependence is
**unknown**: zero direct tokens does not prove zero dependency through imports,
macros or generated proof terms. It requires version-matched compiled
#print axioms or equivalent native dependency inspection. The static stage did not build;
the later native subset has not established full axiom closure.

This release exposes much more source-level kernel-evaluation work than the
old arithmetic-proof corpus. The five-file native panel finds heterogeneous checker/Meta/import hotspots;
its purposeful selection cannot establish population shares. Identifier density
is not a speedup opportunity in seconds.

## Import graph and reuse exposure

The graph resolves the pinned Lake srcDir override for HodgeConjecture.
All163,097 modules are topologically ordered;370,864internal import edges.
The longest unit-weight chain has451modules. The largest same-depth layer has
9,225modules; this is structural width, not safe CPU/RSS concurrency.
The OAI root reaches130,834modules /1,397,800,941source bytes.
[Build-domain audit](default-build-scope/) finds451,008of1,354,379kernel tokens
outside that root, including allPlanarPacking/Transonic source modules.
These static counts do not measure runtime/checks.
External dependency sources/timings are excluded. The initial path-only graph
is preserved in summary.json as a superseded calculation.

25,264cross-group fingerprints cover78,473 lemma/theorem source occurrences.
These compare exact comment-masked declaration bytes using lexical boundaries.
They are candidates for inspection, not elaborated theorem equality, duplicate
kernel work, matching dependencies or safe cross-context proof reuse.
Namespace/options/attributes and dependency obligations are not certified.

## Files and reproduction

- inventory.py enumerates complete Git trees and metadata for an immutable pin.
- scan.py streams the public archive without extracting the1.785GBsource tree.
- static-4eaee875/files.csv.gz and projects.csv contain paths, sizes and groups.
- static-4eaee875/content/ contains compressed per-file metrics/import edges,
  small project/tactic/size summaries, critical path, duplicate candidates,
  complete receipt and the interrupted first-attempt log.
- [Representativeness and native sampling](../../docs/workloads-audit.md).

Use inventory.py --pin with the full revision and --out for metadata, then
scan.py --inventory with that metadata directory and --out for content metrics.
Only small derived tables are committed. Complete source journals remain on
the existing PVC; no upstream candidates are generated or rewritten.

## Execution and limitations

The first G10 attempt was interrupted by Workspace replacement after52,000
logged files, without a completed metric artifact. Its raw progress is retained.
The same Workspace/PVC later appeared on phobos-vt; W made no placement,
credential, security or quota change. A distinct static-only second attempt
completed in697.87analysis seconds with2,140,936KiB process peak RSS; these
are parser costs, not Lean verification times, and clocks are not combined.
The second attempt checkpoints1,000-file compressed journals.

The original static stage stayed below its W5GiB allocation and ran no Lean
or inference. Later partial native work uses W16GiB/8cores, a separate point.
No full project build has completed.
The only observed public workflow is lock-prs.yml; no public build CI was found
at the pin. Whole-project acceptance/axiom closure and the population1.6%/73%runtime
hypothesis remain unknown; native costs exist for the stated subset.
Review is same-chat self-review, not an independent audit.
